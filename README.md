# playground

### description
a heterogeneous blend of miscellaneous scripts and unrelated code samples I don't believe belong in Gist 

### motivation
typically I Like to get my hands dirty when reading through some documentation or checking out a tutorial

### steps:
```sh
$ cd playground
$ find . -name '*.py' | xargs -L 1 python # Go crazy
```
